What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
-a git folder is placed in the directory and git will now begin tracking changes to the files in the directory. If we don't do this step, we can never track changes to the files

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
-the staging area allows you to view changes made to the working directory before actually committing them. It allows you to accept or reject any changes before the commit

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
-we can actually see the changes made to the file before committing it

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?
-if you start making slight mods to a code that change certain parameters, it would be helpful to revert back to other mods

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?
-helps to see which commits are reachable from each different branch

What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in the diagram the way we do?
-combines the changes from the 2 branches into 1 branch, represented like this so we know all the commits from both branches can be seen from the merged branch

What are the pros and cons of Git's automatic merging vs. always doing merges manually?
-provides lines in the file that show where conflicts occur so the user knows exactly where to look for the conflicting lines
