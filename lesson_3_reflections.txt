When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
-if you want to work on the files on multiple computers or with multiple users

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
-this gives you the option to make changes and discard them before pulling or pushing them to the repository
