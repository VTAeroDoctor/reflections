When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
-if you want to work on the files on multiple computers or with multiple users

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
-this gives you the option to make changes and discard them before pulling or pushing them to the repository

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
-fork is used to make a clone of the work of someone else into your own Github directory, clone is used to copy a directory from Github to a local computer, branch is used to make a new path for file changes

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
-this allows you to see if someone has made changes on the remote without informing you

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
-send emails back and forth tracking changes, would be difficult because you would never know which is the most recent version and the exact changes that have been made

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? What benefits does each approach have?
-if you don't know whether the changes will affect the overall product and want to verify with the creator before putting the changes in the main branch
